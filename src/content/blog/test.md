# Supercharge Your Website with wp-graphql API and htmx | Next.js Blog Example with Kythonlk -Blog

Posted August 28, 2023underWebsite Development

**Creating an Interactive Form with htmx and WPGraphQL API**

As developers, we often strive to create web experiences that are both dynamic and user-friendly. One way to achieve this is by leveraging the power of modern JavaScript libraries and APIs. In this blog post, we’ll explore how to build an interactive form using the htmx library and the WPGraphQL API.

### **Introduction to htmx**

htmx is a lightweight JavaScript library that allows developers to create seamless and interactive web applications. Unlike traditional JavaScript frameworks, htmx relies on existing HTML attributes to define interactions, making it a fantastic fit for integrating dynamic features into various platforms. In this example, we’ll use htmx to create a form that communicates with the WPGraphQL API.

### **Setting Up the Environment**

Before diving into the details, ensure that you have a WordPress installation with the WPGraphQL plugin installed and configured. This plugin exposes your WordPress data via a GraphQL API, which we’ll use to submit form data.

### **The HTML Form**

Let’s start by creating a simple HTML form that collects user information. We’ll use htmx attributes to make the form interactive and communicate with the WPGraphQL API. Here’s the basic structure of the form:

```
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Interactive Form with htmx and WPGraphQL</title>
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.5/dist/htmx.min.js"
        ></script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <header><h1>Interactive Form with htmx and WPGraphQL</h1></header>
        <main>
          <form id="contact-form" hx-post="https://kythonlk.com/api/form">
            <!-- Form fields here -->
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
          <div id="response-message"></div>
        </main>
      </body>
    </html>
```

Replace `https://kythonlk.com/api/form` with the actual endpoint where you want to send the form data.

### **Submitting Form Data with htmx**

In the form above, the `hx-post` attribute specifies the endpoint to which the form data will be submitted when the user clicks the “Submit” button. The response from the server will be displayed in the `response-message` element using htmx’s `hx-swap` attribute.

### **WPGraphQL API Integration**

The backend handling the endpoint should be configured to handle the form submission. In this case, we’re assuming that you have a custom endpoint set up to handle the data submission.

### **Security Considerations**

When working with user data and APIs, security is paramount. Make sure to properly validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### **Conclusion**

By combining htmx’s simplicity and interactivity with the power of the WPGraphQL API, you can create forms that seamlessly interact with your WordPress backend. This approach not only enhances user engagement but also provides a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

In this blog post, we’ve explored the integration of htmx and the WPGraphQL API to create an interactive form. By understanding the fundamentals of these technologies, you’re well-equipped to take your web development skills to the next level and create impressive user experiences.
